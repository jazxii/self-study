#Python Strings is the immutable array of bytes representing Unicode characters. 
# Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

#Note: As strings are immutable, modifying a string will result in creating a new copy.

String = "Welcome to GeeksForGeeks"
print("Creating String: ")
print(String)
	
# Printing First character
print("\nFirst character of String is: ")
print(String[0])
	
# Printing Last character
print("\nLast character of String is: ")
print(String[-1])
